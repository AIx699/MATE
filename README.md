# MATE: A Motion-Aware Dynamic Attention and Temporal-Conditioned Convolution Encoder for Efficient Anomaly Detection

This repository implements a compact motion-conditioned architecture for weakly-supervised video anomaly detection . The model conditions attention and pooling on an explicit MotionMap derived from feature differences and operates on precomputed X3D features extracted from UCF-Crime videos.
